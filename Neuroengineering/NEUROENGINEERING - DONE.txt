neuron's basic functions are:	1. <b>Collection</b> of information from multiple sources<br>2. <b>Integration</b> - processing of incoming info to provide binary decision<br>3. <b>Generation</b> and <b>Propagation</b> - of the bit information to target cells (other neural and muscle)<br>
Neuron parts are:	Dendrites (inputs), Cell body, Axon Hillock, Myelinated axon, Axon terminal (outputs)
four main ion families:	Na+ K+ Cl- and Ca++
Describe neural membrane	phospholipid bilayer, ion pumps and channels
what is a difference in electrical potential between the interior and external of a neuron at rest?	-70mV (internal part more negative). The number is a sum of all diffusional and electrical forces. (nernst equation)
Nernst equation:	ŒîŒº = RT ln [ùëã]<sub>ùê¥</sub>/[ùëã]<sub>B</sub>&nbsp;+ zF(E<sub> A</sub> ‚àí E <sub>B</sub> )<br>first part diffusional forces, second - electrical forces
Depolarization:	ion+ go inside the membrane or opn- go outside the cell =&gt; <b>Reduction of the negativity of internal environment w.r.t external one</b>
Hyperpolarization	ion- goes inside the membrane or ion+ leaes the cell. (there are also 2 types: Repolarization and hyperpolarization)
Repolarization	hyperpolarization (increase in internal negativity) if the membrane was depolarized before (reduced negativity of internal environment)&nbsp;
hyperpolarization	if the membrane was polarized before and internal negativity still increases (was more negative than -70mV)
Synapses:	"point where two cells meet and exchange the information. most common are chemical synapses. info exchange is Not a bidirectional
<br>exchange but a unidimensional one from PRE-synapses cell to the
<br>POST-synapses cell."
Synaptic cleft:	the space between pre and post synapses.&nbsp;
Neurotransmitters:	chemical transmitters taking part in information exchange.
neurotransmitters' role is:	opening some specific ion gated channels in postsynaptic membrane. The ion channel will open when the neurotransmitter (released by presynaptic cell) reches a receptor in the postsynaptic membrane. Neurotransmitter is like a key, the receptor is the lock that opens the ion channels.
excitatory synapses	releases a neutortansmitter that opens a port for examples for Na+ and generates a depolarization.<br><br>
inhibitory sinapses:	generate a neurotransmitter generationg hyperpolarization (for examples Cl-).
hyperpolarization has _____ effect while Depolarization _______ .&nbsp;	inhibitory, excitatory
A variation of the membrane potential which appears only in neural, muscular and cardiac cells	What is an action potential
What is an action potential	A variation of the membrane potential which appears only in neural, muscular and cardiac cells
Describe action potential	&gt; brings information, <br>&gt; is propagated to othe cells. <br>&gt; it is all-or-none process.<br>&gt; is only triggered after the stimulus reaches the treshold<br>&gt; always the same shape, duration and intensity, irrespectively of stimulus amplitude.
there are two kinds of action potential propagation	point to point propagation (unmyelinated axons)<br>Saltatory propagation (myelinated axons)
point to point propagation	unmyelinated axons: the action potential is generated at each membrane section, it is propagated in one direction; refractory period guarantees no back propagation
Saltatory propagation - myelinated axons	there is myelinated sheath, <b>we dont have gated channels, </b>but rather voltage-gated channels at Ranvier nodes (·Éê·Éò ·Éõ·Éò·Éî·Éö·Éò·Éú·Éò ·É†·Éù ·É¨·Éß·Éì·Éî·Éë·Éê ·Éò·É•). propagation happens passively with the intra and extra membrane ion flows. it isnt as strong as point to point, but is sufficient enough to trigger another AP in next Ranvier node. It is faster and can propagate AP in longer distances
Grey matter composition:	Cell bodies and dendrites
white matter contains	myelinated axons
T-synaptic plasticity	when we do the same action several times, the neurotransmitter number between presynaptic and postsynaptic cell change and strengthen. so the velocity of info increases.
Local Field Potentials (LPF):	is the extracellular current flow resulting from the linear summation of PSP (Post Synaptic Potential)
what is palisade&nbsp;	&nbsp;when the cells are parallel to each other and are close as well.
neurons that produce closed field (cancellation before it reaches the electrodes) are orientated like:	radially simmetric neurons<br>randomly orientated neurons<br>asynchronously activated neurons
open field is created by the neurons which are orientated:	alligned and synchronous, currents sum and conduct to the electrodes
what kind of activity is mainly captured by the EEG?	NOT action potentials but post-synaptic potentials, which are slower and easier to sum up
Limitation of scalp EEG	- Spatial blur; cuz of many layers for a signal to go through, it gets dissipated. deeper the distance, worse the signal. also only high num of synchronous neurons' signal can be captured.<br>- Low signal-to-noise ratio<br>- Multiple sources contribute to the single electrode signal<br>- Near electrodes record partially overlapped signals<br>- Reference choice<br>
Advantage of scalp EEG	- Non-invasive<br>- Easy to use<br>- Portable<br>- Inexpensive<br>- Covers the entire cortical surface<br>- Gives excellent temporal resolution
Explain Neural decoding	finding the stimulus that more likely produces the spike train that it has induced
preferred and opposite response	preferred response is called when the neuron response changes with the input, opposite is opposite
discriminability	"when two different distributions are gaussian
<br>can be defined as the difference between their means divided by
<br>the standard deviation.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt; ùëü + &gt; ‚àí &lt; ùëü ‚àí &gt;

<br>system. An electrical synapse allows a direct signal transmission from an electrical source (PRE

<br>cases the exchange of information is mono-directional (SENDER-&gt;RECEIVER). This type of synapse
<br>allows a physical contact between the two cells through a protein called Gap Junction.<br><img src=""paste-f292b43d5ad870f235122438d18e20de68656b41.jpg""><br>"

List the four main neuronal mechanisms behind brain plasticity	"The first SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY. When we learn there in an incremental
<br>of the neurotransmitter between the presynaptic and the postsinaptic cell. If
<br>we make something for several ours, the amount of neurotransmitter increases.
<br>The second is the AXONAL SPROUTING (OR PRUNING) that consists in the
<br>formation of new synapses. The third is the AXONAL REGENERATION. This
<br>is typical in the prenatal period and in critical situation but less in adult age.
<br>Finally there is the UNMASKING OF LATENT SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS.
<br>The synapses are not used until they are need because of a lesion."
Intracellular recordings can be made with two different ways that lead to the same outcome:	"<ul><li>Sharp electrodes inserted through the membrane into the cell
</li><li>Patch electrodes sealed to the surface of the membrane providing electrical contact with the interior of the cell</li></ul><div>Patch electrodes does not require an actual membrane penetration and usually is preferred since it is
<br>more easy in practice.<br></div>"
what and how do we measure with extracellular recording?	electrodes are placed near the membrane, not penetrating it. we measure the potential of the extracellular fluid. exact moment of AP is captured, but not its shape or amplitude, as amplitude is reduced&nbsp;( 0.1mV instead of 100mV ). membrane variations arent captured, thus the result is a spike train
what is captured when we measure the activity of a small group of neurons?&nbsp;	"instead of AP (very short and impossible to synchronize) we measure the extracellular current flow
<br>resulting from the linear summation of PSP"

Describe which part of the pyramidal neuron acts as a current dipole and how	"The part is the dendrite (or apical dendrite) because it is like a dipole with
<br>one charge here at distance d from the other which is the basal dendrite (but we
<br>can consider also the soma) of the cell. When the post-synaptic neuron receives
<br>an excitatory signal from an active axon terminal, positive ions flows in the den-
<br>drite. So the intracellular space becomes more positive making the extracellular
<br>space relatively more negative at the reception site. The extracellular space
<br>at the basal dendrite, above the soma, is now more positive, so it makes the
<br>intracellular space more negative. Now in the apical dendrite we have a positive
<br>charges and in the basal dendrite or in the soma the negative ones. It means
<br>that a current from + (source) to -(sink) will be generated, creating an intracel-
<br>lular current, and the charges in the extracellular space create an extracellular
<br>current that has opposite direction with respect to the intracellular current. For
<br>an hinibitory cell is the same, but the polarity of the dipole is reversed."

Which regions of the brain mainly contributes to scalp EEG? Why?	"The part is the cortex because pyramidal neurons produce an open field and
<br>in particular neurons that are on the gyri produce most of the EEG signal with
<br>respect to neurons that are in the sulci. All the neurons are oriented normally
<br>to the cortical surface, so the signal is propagated on the surface. But since
<br>the neurons can be seen as dipole and the produce current, this current is more
<br>captured in the gyri. While in the sulci it is attenuated, because we have, in a
<br>double layer of the cortical surface; in this case on each layer we have a current
<br>that has the same intensity and direction but opposite verse. It means that in
<br>the sulci the current eliminate each other, so the signal in this part will not be recorded from the EEG. Moreover the neurons are organized in palisades,
<br>or more specifically they are parallel each other, it means that the resulting
<br>signal of each neuron is summed up to that of the other neurons. The last reason
<br>is the longitudinal shape of the pyramidal neurons, so the signal generated
<br>flows towards the cortical surface."

What is coherence?	"Coherence is essentially the same concept of correlation but defined in frequency domain using

What are the advantage of the ordinary coherence?	<ul><li>Easy to compute: All the computation is based on well-known Fourier transformation&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Useful to build a graph: For each frequency, we can build a coherence network in which nodes are EEG signals and arcs are weighted with coherence</li></ul>
What are the limitations for the ordinary coherence?	<ul><li>Non-oriented graph: The graph that we can build cannot be oriented since ordinary coherence is symmetrical ( C (f ) = C (f ) ), therefore it do not give any information about the direction of the interaction&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>No causality: A consequence of the previous property is that coherence measures synchronicity but not causality&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Bivariate: It‚Äôs bivariate (what if the time series are more than 2?)</li></ul>
"Explain the difference between anatomical and functional/effective
<br>connectivity"	"For the anatomical connectivity there is a physical link between the 2 parts
<br>that are connected, for instance this can be an axon of fiber. While in the case
<br>of functional connectivity, we have always the physical link, but it can be used
<br>or not and at different levels. They are different also in the time scale, in fact
<br>at longer time scale (hours to days) the anatomical structure can be subjected
<br>to significant morphological changes and plasticity, but it is relatively stable at
<br>shorter time scales (seconds to minutes); while the functional connectivity is
<br>subject to changes at lower time scales (milliseconds)."
Explain the difference between correlation and causation*	"The correlation means that 2 events happen at the same time, while causa-
<br>tion means that an even is the cause of another one, so a changing in an event
<br>caused a changing in the other one."

<br>of the following sentences, if they are true or false:

We can define the concept of causality between two quantities in two different ways.	.PHYSICAL INFLUENCE<br>.TEMPORAL PRECEDENCE

<br>influences another quantity y if changing the cause (or control) x also the consequence y changes."	"The first way to define causality is by studying their <span class=""cloze"" data-ordinal=""1"">physical influence</span>. A quantity x physically
<br>influences another quantity y if changing the cause (or control) x also the consequence y changes.<br>
"
Main limitations of physical influence (list 2)	<ol><li>if we want to test two regions phisical influence, we must do lab experiment. the procedure can be invasive or noninvasive (injecting current). in any way, we are gonna physically act on subjects brain, influencing the brain activity.</li><li>we do separate experiment for each hypothesis. e.g: does x influence y? --&gt; experiment 1; does y influence x? --&gt; experiment 2&nbsp;</li></ol>
advantages of temporal precendence	<ul><li>single experiment, multiple hypothesis tests</li><li>easy to use</li><li>non interventional, doesnt influence subject's brain activity.</li></ul>
disadvantages of temporal precedence	because we cant check physically for causality, we can fall in, for instance, common source problem.
define&nbsp;causality is the statistical sense	"Given two simultaneously measured signals y , x , if one can predict the first signal y better by
<br>incorporating the past information from the second signal x than using only information from
<br>the first one y , then the second signal x can be called causal to the first one y (Wiener, 1956)."
"Wiener provides to us only a general theoretical concept about statistic causality that can be
<br>summarized in the following three steps:"	"Step 1: Predict y future with only y past values
<br>Step 2: Predict y future with y and x past values
<br>Step 3: If we obtained better prediction performance in step 2 then x causes y"
